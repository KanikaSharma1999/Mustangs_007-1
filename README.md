OBJECTIVE: Our objective is to design a model that can help food chains to manage their food distribution business more efficiently by knowing the demands at distribution centers .

DREAMED: Our main concern is about the food scarcity in the world where unwanted food is wasted and a large part of our community suffer from Famine.

APPROACH: Our approach is to design such a system that can provide forecasts of demanded food so that unwanted food doesn't get wasted and managed properly. So by analyzing previous datasets we can forecast the meals needed at the centers and supply particular meal where it is required.
For this we analysed the data using data visualization techniques and then coming up with an approach where we can ask the client for the center_id and the meal_id to predict the demand of that meal_id using our Machine Learning model. We have used combination of multiple models to predict the demand. In this way we will be able to forecast the demand of a meal at a particular center and be able to save unwanted food from getting wasted and make food chains business more profitable.

PLAN: Our plan is to build a web app or a website where users can upload their datasets and our system will be able to forecast the demand of food at particular center. Governments provides food items to various centers to help needy people of our community , so our application can help government schemes to be implemented in better way. This application can also be used by fast food chains to avoid loss and will be able to pre-plan their food distribution in a better way to avoid wastage of resources and to earn profit.
